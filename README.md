5.1P: Containerisation of a simple web application using Docker
Introduction 
This document demonstrates how to containerize a Node.js web application using Docker and Docker Compose. 
Prerequisites
1.	GIT
2.	Visual Studio Code
3.	Node.js
4.	Docker
Part I: Containerizing the Application
Step-1 Creating base folder and Node.js Environment
The steps include creating a new directory and initializing the project using npm.
Step-2 Creating Docker file
The Dockerfile defines the applicationâ€™s environment and the instructions needed to build the Docker image. 
Step-3 Build Docker image
The Docker image is built based on the Dockerfile created in the previous step. The image will contain all the necessary dependencies and configurations.
Step-4 Create Compose file
The Docker Compose file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications and then test the application.
Step-5 Pushing file
After building the Docker image and creating the Compose file, the next step is to push the Docker image to a container
Part II: Implementing Container Health Checks
Health checks monitor the status of your application, ensuring it is functioning correctly. 
In docker-compose.yml file, under the app service, we add the healthcheck configuration
Conclusion 
Using docker and Docker compose we have successfully containerized Node.js application.
Putting health checks in place guarantees that your application will continue to function dependably and be able to automatically fix any problems.
